## Assigment

### Movie database
We’d like you to build simple REST API for us - a basic movie database interacting with external API. Here’s full specification of endpoints that we’d like it to have:

* POST /movies:
    * Request body should contain only movie title, and its presence should be validated.
    * Based on passed title, other movie details should be fetched from http://www.omdbapi.com/ (or other similar, public movie database) - and saved to application database.
    * Request response should include full movie object, along with all data fetched from external API.
* GET /movies:
    * Should fetch list of all movies already present in application database.
    * Additional filtering, sorting is fully optional - but some implementation is a bonus.
* POST /comments:
    * Request body should contain ID of movie already present in database, and comment text body.
    * Comment should be saved to application database and returned in request response.
* GET /comments:
    * Should fetch list of all comments present in application database.
    * Should allow filtering comments by associated movie, by passing its ID. 


### Rules & hints​

* Your goal is to implement REST API in Django, however you're free to use any third-party libraries and database of your choice - sharing your reasoning behind choosing them is welcome!
* At least basic tests of endpoints and their functionality are obligatory. Their exact scope and form is left up to you.
* The application's code should be kept in a public repository so that we can read it, pull it and build it ourselves. Remember to include README file or at least basic notes on application requirements and setup - we should be able to easily and quickly get it running.
* Written application must be hosted and publicly available for us online - we recommend Heroku.
